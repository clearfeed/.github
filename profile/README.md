# Hello World 👋

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clearfeed/.github/main/images/ClearFeed%20Logo%20-%20black.svg" /></p>

We are building [ClearFeed](https://clearfeed.ai/) and we have been building since April 18, 2021 - that's when we made our first commit.

The ClearFeed stack is mostly written in TypeScript. We heavily use the following tools & frameworks:
- Nest JS
- Next JS
- Sequelize
- Postgres

🧠 Our brain is called as _Sage_ and it helps us make sense of conversations that happen across different tools in an organization.

💡 We also use ClearFeed at ClearFeed to stay on top of things and be more productive.
